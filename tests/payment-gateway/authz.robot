Documentation    Payment Gateway authorization scope matrix, asserted at the gateway edge
...              (Traefik authproxy + cerbos). Mirrors the manual scope-matrix validation this
...              suite replaces: listPaymentDefinitions is public; listPaymentProviders needs
...              payment-provider:read; a token missing that scope is denied (403) even though
...              it authenticates successfully.
...
...              The ``local-k8s-only`` tagged cases below additionally corroborate the HTTP
...              assertion against the authproxy's Authz Decision log (kubectl) for the
...              listPaymentProviders operation — a deliberate, narrow exception to this suite's
...              normal "no kubectl" rule. They call `Skip Unless Local Kubernetes` first and
...              skip cleanly outside the local k3d dev cluster, so CI never fails on them. See
...              AGENTS.md "Local-only pod-log corroboration" for the full rationale/scope, and
...              `resources/payment_gateway.resource` for why these mirror auditflow's edge
...              corroboration but not its backend-delivery corroboration.
