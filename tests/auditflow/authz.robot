Documentation    AuditFlow authentication & authorization regression, asserted entirely at the
...              gateway edge (Traefik authproxy + cerbos). Mirrors the manual scope-matrix
...              validation this suite replaces: a token with the wrong scope must be denied
...              (403), the correct scope must be allowed (200), and missing/malformed
...              credentials must be rejected (401) before any Authz Decision is made.
...
...              The ``local-k8s-only`` tagged cases below additionally corroborate the HTTP
...              assertion against kubectl pod logs (authproxy Authz Decision + AuditFlow
...              backend delivery) — a deliberate, narrow exception to this suite's normal
...              "no kubectl" rule. They call `Skip Unless Local Kubernetes` first and skip
...              cleanly outside the local k3d dev cluster, so CI never fails on them. See
...              AGENTS.md "Local-only pod-log corroboration" for the full rationale/scope.
