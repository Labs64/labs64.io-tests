Documentation    Tenant isolation at the gateway edge for the AuditFlow tenant model
...              (silo routing, ingest gate, authoritative tenant stamping).
...
...              The gateway-derived tenant (token ``tenant`` claim → ``X-Auth-Tenant``) is
...              authoritative: a client-supplied ``tenantId`` in the payload must NEVER
...              influence which tenant an event is stamped, gated, or routed as. The local
...              mock-oidc provider mints every token with the same fixed ``tenant: t_mock``
...              claim (no second-tenant persona exists yet), so a literal two-tenant matrix
...              cannot be minted here; these cases instead prove the two facts that ARE
...              observable at the edge: (1) a spoofed body tenantId changes nothing, and
...              (2) when the ingest gate rejects, it does so with the contract's 403
...              ``TENANT_NOT_PROVISIONED`` shape, never a 5xx.
